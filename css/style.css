/* Apple
The apple tree (Malus pumila, commonly and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in 
the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a 
fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, 
where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of 
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious 
and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.

Banana
The banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous 
flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, 
in contrast to dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually 
elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, 
red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost 
all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa 
balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × 
paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old 
scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.

Cherry
The cherry fruits of commerce usually are obtained from a limited number of species such as c
ultivars of the sweet cherry, Prunus avium. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree, and is 
sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental 
cherry", "cherry blossom", etc. Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside of 
cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the 
British Isles.

Grape
Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, grape 
seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally 
occurring in clusters.

Orange
The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). 
It has genes that are ~25% pomelo and ~75% mandarin; however, it is not a simple backcrossed BC1 hybrid, 
but hybridized over multiple generations. The chloroplast genes, and therefore the maternal line, seem to 
be pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. Earlier estimates of the percentage of pomelo 
genes varying from ~50% to 6% have been reported.

Peach
The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim 
Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Shan mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. 
It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a nectarine.

Pear
The pear is any of several tree and shrub species of genus Pyrus, in the family Rosaceae. It is also the 
name of the pomaceous fruit of the trees. Several species of pear are valued for their edible fruit and 
juices, while others are cultivated as ornamental trees.

Pineapple
Pineapples can be consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, or preserved. They are found in a wide array of cuisines. 
In addition to consumption, the pineapple leaves are used to produce the textile fiber piña in the 
Philippines, commonly used as the material for the men's barong Tagalog and women's baro't saya formal 
wear in the country. The fiber is also used as a component for wallpaper and other furnishings.

Strawberry
The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the 
genus Fragaria (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. 
The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for 
its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. */
